"PyTorch is a open source python package that has high level features of Tensor computation 
(like numpy) with strong GPU acceleration and Deep Neural Networks built on a tape-based autograd 
system. PyTorch is a library has below components/ packages available on the website as: torch 
(a Tensor library like NumPy, with strong GPU support), torch.autograd (a tape based automatic
differentiation library that supports all differentiable Tensor operations in torch), torch.
nn (a neural networks library deeply integrated with autograd designed for maximum flexibility), 
torch.optim (an optimization package to be used with torch.nn with standard optimization methods
such as SGD, RMSProp, LBFGS, Adam etc.), torch.multiprocessing (python multiprocessing, but with
magical memory sharing of torch Tensors across processes. Useful for data loading and 
hogwild training), torch.utils (DataLoader, Trainer and other utility functions for convenience),
torch.legacy(.nn/.optim) (legacy code that has been ported over from torch for backward 
compatibility reasons)"~\cite{PyTorch}
