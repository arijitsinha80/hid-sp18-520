``OrientDB is a Multi-Model database with Distributed NoSQL engine, which can work with Graph, Document, 
Key-Value, GeoSpatial and Reactive models. User Domains and any data seach which supports the Object 
Oriented concepts for modeling can be implemented with this technology. Each model is not just a layer, 
but coexists in one single engine. With OrientDB Teleporter you can easily sync (or migrate) your 
relational database from Oracle速, SQLServer速, MySQL速 and PostgreSQL速 to OrientDB'' \cite{OrientDB}.
``OrientDB is perfect and scale up by adding more server instances with zero-configuration'' \cite{OrientDB-cloud}.
