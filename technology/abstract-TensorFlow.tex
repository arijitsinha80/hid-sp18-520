\section{TensorFlow}
TensorFlow is an open source providing flexible architecture of using a single API for deploying computation to one or more CPU’s and GPU’s in a desktop, server or mobile devices. It facilitates with software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research \cite{TensorFlow}.
